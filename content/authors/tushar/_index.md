I am Tushar, currently a post-doctoral research associate at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/). I am working with [Dr. Adam A. Stokes](http://stokesresearchgroup.com/) on sensing and data science solutions for the renewable energy industries under the [ORCA (Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets)](https://orcahub.org/) project. My research area lies at the junction of machine learning, robotics, internet of things, and decenentralisation. Recently, I have picked up an interest on applying [Transfer Learning](http://ruder.io/transfer-learning/) and [Federated Computing](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html) across industrial IoT applications.

I received my PhD and MTech from the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG)](http://www.iitg.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Prof. S. B. Nair](http://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/robotics/) on "Decentralising Intelligence in Cyber-Physical Systems". I am passionate about inter-disciplinary and applied research.
